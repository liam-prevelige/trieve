# vite-env.d.ts

dashboard/src/vite-env.d.ts

### Purpose
This file is a TypeScript declaration file that provides type definitions for Vite's client-side API. It ensures that TypeScript can recognize and correctly type-check Vite-specific features and modules.

### Flow
The file uses a triple-slash directive to reference the type definitions from the `vite/client` module. This directive informs the TypeScript compiler to include the types from Vite's client, enabling type safety and IntelliSense support for Vite-specific functionalities in the project.
