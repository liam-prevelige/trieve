chat/src/vite-env.d.ts

### Purpose
This file is used to provide TypeScript type definitions for Vite, a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

### Flow
The `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` directive at the top of the file tells TypeScript to include type definitions from the `vite/client` module. This ensures that TypeScript can recognize and provide type checking and IntelliSense for Vite-specific features and configurations in the project.
