### Purpose
The `auth_middleware` module is designed to handle authentication-related middleware functionalities within the application. It ensures that requests are properly authenticated before they reach the core application logic.

### Flow
The `auth_middleware` module is declared as a public module using `pub mod auth_middleware;`. This makes the authentication middleware functionalities accessible to other parts of the application, allowing them to integrate authentication checks seamlessly.
