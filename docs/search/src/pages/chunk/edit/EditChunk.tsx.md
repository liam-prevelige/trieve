### Purpose
The `EditChunk` component is designed to provide a user interface for editing a specific document chunk. It integrates various sub-components and layouts to create a cohesive page for this purpose.

### Flow
1. **Imports**: The file imports necessary components (`Footer`, `SearchLayout`, `EditChunkPageForm`) and a routing component (`A` from `@solidjs/router`).

2. **Component Definition**: The `EditChunk` component is defined as a functional component that takes `props` as an argument.

3. **Layout**: The component is wrapped in a `SearchLayout` to provide a consistent layout structure.

4. **Header Section**: 
   - A clickable logo and title are rendered at the top, which link back to the homepage (`href="/"`).
   - The logo is an image sourced from a URL, and the title is "Edit Document Chunk".

5. **Form Section**:
   - The `EditChunkPageForm` component is rendered, which takes `chunkId` from `props.params.id` and a `defaultResultChunk` object with default values.

6. **Footer**: The `Footer` component is rendered at the bottom of the page.

7. **Styling**: Various CSS classes are used to style the layout, including margins, padding, and flexbox properties to ensure proper alignment and spacing.
