### Purpose
The `NotFound` component is designed to display a 404 error page when a user navigates to a route that does not exist within the application.

### Flow
1. **Imports**: The file imports `SearchLayout` from the `layouts` directory and `Footer` from the `components` directory.
2. **Component Definition**: The `NotFound` component is defined as a functional component.
3. **Return Statement**: 
   - The component returns a `SearchLayout` wrapper.
   - Inside the `SearchLayout`, it includes:
     - Two `div` elements with `flex-1` class for spacing.
     - A central `div` with `flex w-full flex-col items-center` classes containing:
       - A `p` element displaying "404 Not Found" with `text-3xl` class.
       - An `a` element styled with `text-xl text-turquoise-500 underline` that links back to the homepage.
