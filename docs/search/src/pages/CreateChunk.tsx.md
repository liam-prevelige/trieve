### Purpose
The `CreateChunk` file is responsible for rendering a user interface that allows users to create a new document chunk. It integrates various components to provide a cohesive layout and functionality.

### Flow
1. **Layout Setup**: The `SearchLayout` component is used to wrap the entire content, providing a consistent layout structure.
2. **Header Section**: 
   - A clickable logo and title are centered at the top, linking back to the homepage (`href="/"`).
   - The logo image is sourced from a URL and displayed with a specific width.
3. **Form Section**: 
   - The `CreateNewDocChunkForm` component is rendered within a div that has responsive padding and width constraints.
4. **Footer Section**: 
   - The `Footer` component is included at the bottom of the layout.
