## Usage Details
- **/search/src/components/EditChunkPageForm.tsx**:
  - This file does not directly interact with the Tika service. Instead, it focuses on fetching and updating chunk data from the backend API. The chunk data includes HTML content, which could potentially be generated or processed by Tika, but this is not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.

- **/server/src/bin/file-worker.rs**:
  - This file contains the `upload_file` function, which is responsible for handling file uploads. The function retrieves the file from an S3 bucket and then sends it to the Tika service for HTML conversion. The Tika service URL is obtained from the environment variable `TIKA_URL`. The converted HTML content is then used to create file chunks, which are subsequently processed and stored. This ensures that the uploaded file is in a consistent HTML format, making it easier to handle and display within the application.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `TIKA_URL` environment variable is correctly set in the deployment environment to avoid runtime errors.
- The Tika service is crucial for maintaining a consistent format for file content, which simplifies further processing and display within the application.
- Proper error handling is implemented to manage potential issues when interacting with the Tika service, such as network errors or invalid responses. This helps maintain the robustness of the file upload process.
